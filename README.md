## Project Overview
This project analyzes a **banking dataset** to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, account balances, and transaction patterns.  
The analysis includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **visualization of correlations**, and the foundation for **predictive analytics**.

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Methods:** Data Cleaning, Numerical Analysis, Predictive Functions  

---

##  Key Features
✔️ Loaded and explored real-world banking data (`Banking.csv`)  
✔️ Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and anomalies  
✔️ Built **visualizations** including distribution plots and correlation heatmaps  
✔️ Implemented **predictive components** to forecast financial behavior  
✔️ Structured workflow for **scalable future ML models**

##  Results & Insights
- Found strong correlations between customer attributes and account balances  
- Visualized key trends such as** balance distribution and purchase frequency**  
- Built an initial **predictive framework** for forecasting customer behavior
